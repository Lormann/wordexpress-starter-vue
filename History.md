# V.2.0

I have since moved the GraphQL server into its own stand-alone repo called [WordExpress Server](https://github.com/ramsaylanier/WordExpress-Server). V.1.X of this repo included the GraphQL server and schema, etc. If you are migrating from V.1.X, you'll first need to clone the WordExpress Server repo and follow the instructions on setting it up.
